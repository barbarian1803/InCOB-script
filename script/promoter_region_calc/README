This script is used to generate promoter region based on specifed length.
This script requires 6 parameters:
1. Gene annotation file in the form of GTF, for example Ensembl GTF file that can be downloaded from Ensembl FTP
2. Integer that indicates promoter region length
3. File that contains gene name/ID that the promoter region will be calculated. The name or ID of the gene should match GTF file
4. Output file name
5. per_transcript or per_gene, per_transcript means the promoter region will be generated seperately for each transcript, per gene means the promoter region will be merged for all transcript for same gene
6. Huan genome fasta file, for example Ensembl fasta file that can be downloaded from Ensembl FTP.
